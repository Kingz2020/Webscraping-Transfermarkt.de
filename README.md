scraping a well-known football website for data to be used for ML

The idea was to gather some webscraping skills which I will use for fantasy premier league analysis in the near future. 

- The code comprises of techniques to scrape general stats , profile, and moreover the higher charts of transfermarkt.de

# Content
- Main.py -  a file with the concluding python code for the webscraping of stats, profile, and higher charts
- summary.ipynb contains a few analysis from teh the higher charts info.

# Information gathered
- Data from 2010 to 2020 were collected
- 145K datasets was collected alone for the higher charts.

# Conclusion
- Transfermarkt.de is a great site for information in general. For the necessary information regarding fantasy premier league forecasting, it will make sense to use more detailed  sites like understat.com
- The exercise gave me an insight into the techniques of webscraping and the difficulties which might arise.
